The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The d3 library was used to read in the json data from the URL provided by the USGS. A map was created using Leaflet to plot all earthquake activity from the past seven days. The magnitude and depth of the earthquake is indicated by the size and color of each marker. Earthquakes with higher magnitude are larger in size and earthquakes with greater depth are darker in color. Further information about each earthquake can be found via marker popups.
